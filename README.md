With a diverse professional background in education and geotechnical engineering, I am currently pursuing a Doctorate in Civil Engineering with a research focus on applying artificial intelligence to predict the properties of clay soils. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am currently studying Data Science Bootcamp at Gomycode Algeria and am in the process of completing the program.

Through my coursework, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and data analysis software. My experiences range from teaching middle school mathematics to managing a private school and working as a geotechnical engineering consultant. I am skilled in a range of software and programming languages including Excel, Python, C++, and MATLAB, and I am proficient in Plaxis, Talren, QGIS, and GEO5. Fluent in Arabic and French, with a working knowledge of English and Spanish, I am open to new opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to the engineering community.
